Software testing assignment using a ladder programme


Question
#####################################################################################
Application:
From:	CA165	Programming	Exam	2	Question	1	2015
A	man	who	makes	wooden	ladders	isn't	too	precise	with	his	measurements	and	
the	steps	on	his	ladders	are	not	necessarily	equidistant	(i.e.	equally	spaced).	
The	safety	officer	is	concerned	about	these	irregular	steps	and	has	come	to	check	
the	ladders.	In	each	case	he	measures	the	location	of	each	step	starting	from	the	
bottom	of	the	ladder	and	continuing	up	the	ladder	in	sequence.	
The	safety	officer	wants	to	analyse	the	data	and	you	have	been	hired	to	write	a	
program to	help	do	that.	
The	program	should	
read	in	the	series	of	measurements	
find	the	largest	gap	between	the	steps
Note	that	the	safety	officer	is	only	interested	in	the	gaps	between	the	steps	
and	so	is	not	interested	in	the	height	of	the	first	step	from	the	ground.
Here	are	two	examples.	
Example	1	
How many steps:
4
Enter the locations:
10 21 30 39
The largest gap is 11.
In	this	situation,	there	are	steps	at	positions	10,	21,	30	and	39.	The	two	which	are	
furthest	apart	are	at	positions	10	and	21	and	they	are	11	units	apart.	
Example	2	
How many steps:
5
Enter the locations:
198 285 390 491 587
The largest gap is 105.
This	time,	the	largest	gap	is	between	the	steps	located	at	285	and	390	and	the	
gap	is	105	units.
Software	Testing	Assignment.
Use	the	information	you	have	learned	from	this	course	to	devise	test	
methods	and	test	cases for	the	assignment	described	above.
